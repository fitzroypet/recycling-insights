# Global Recycling Insights Dashboard - Project Report

## Executive Summary
This project develops an interactive data visualization dashboard that explores global recycling patterns and their relationships with economic and demographic factors. The dashboard provides insights into how GDP, population density, and other metrics correlate with recycling performance across different continents.

## Project Objectives
1. Visualize the relationship between economic development (GDP) and recycling rates
2. Analyze how population density impacts recycling effectiveness
3. Identify leading countries in recycling initiatives
4. Enable comparative analysis across continents

## Data Analysis

### Data Sources and Processing
- **Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2022**
  - Recycling scores
  - Waste recovery rates
- **World Bank Data**
  - GDP per capita
  - Population statistics
- **Population Density Data**
  - Density per square kilometer
  - Area calculations

### Key Findings

#### 1. GDP vs Recycling Performance
```python
# Example visualization code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='gdpPerCapita', y='EPIRecyclingScore_2022', 
                hue='continent', size='population')
plt.title('GDP per Capita vs Recycling Score by Continent')
```

**Observations:**
- Strong positive correlation between GDP and recycling scores
- European countries generally show higher performance
- Notable outliers in Asia showing high recycling scores despite lower GDP

#### 2. Population Density Impact
- High-density areas show varied recycling performance
- No direct correlation between density and recycling effectiveness
- Urban areas tend to have more structured recycling programs

#### 3. Continental Analysis
| Continent | Avg Recycling Score | Avg GDP per Capita | Top Performer |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Europe    | 67.8             | $34,500          | Germany       |
| Asia      | 45.2             | $15,300          | Japan         |
| Americas  | 42.1             | $22,400          | Canada        |
| Oceania   | 39.5             | $31,200          | New Zealand   |
| Africa    | 28.3             | $3,400           | South Africa  |
